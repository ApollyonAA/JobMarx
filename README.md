## JobMarx
I'm tired of opening 10 links and 10 canva tabs for every job application I need to fill out.
So this is a small project dedicated to scraping and simplifying the job hunting process. 
 
**Build Status:**<br> The mere whisper of a skeleton

**Language:**<br> Python for now

**Installation:**<br> Download and run in ur favorite IDE for now.

**Current goals:**
 - Scrape Monster 
 - Scrape Indeed
 - Search that data in some way
 - Maybe make something a function who knows

**Contributions:**<br>
God if for some reason you wanted to do that I'm trying to 
do something here in my free time for now. So no thank you for now. 

**Credits:**<br>
Me :)
